Mod2Challenge is a historic charting and summary of ticker price change of stock per calendar year

## Usage
The excel spreadsheet contains a button to launch the population of Summary Data.
It is present on the 1st sheet and will populate all sheets in the workbook.

There is a seperate VBA script file which is a copy of what is within the spreadsheet.
The script requires the excel workbook to run across data as it needs the atomic data within. 

A word document of resultant screenshots is also included to assist in marking or to attract enquiries
